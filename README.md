# Cloud-Projects
This repository was created in order to showcase and document the AWS projects I have completed in the pursuit of knowledge and growth. As of July 22nd, 2024 I have achieved 4 AWS certifications and continue to study daily in pursuit of my dream to become a Solutions Architect. It is important to demonstrate that I can apply the theortical concepts I am learning through real world application and not just certification. Additionally, I would like to make this repository available to my fellow professionals who are attempting to transition into cloud roles so that they may have an additional resource to assist in their journey.
